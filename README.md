# 💝 Valentine's Day Proposal Website

A romantic, interactive, and animated web experience designed to ask that special someone to be your Valentine. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project features glassmorphism UI, a reactive "No" button, a blooming flower animation, and a personalized photo gallery.

## Features

* **🔒 Security Check:** A login screen that restricts access to a specific name (e.g., "Therese").
* **🐻 Cute Animations:** Integrated GIFs to set the mood.
* **🖱️ Reactive UI:** A playful "No" button that shrinks while the "Yes" button grows with every click, making rejection impossible!
* **🌹 Live Blooming Flower:** A CSS-only animation of a rose growing and blooming upon acceptance.
* **🎉 Celebration Mode:** Triggers professional-grade confetti and a background music track ("Helpless" from Hamilton).
* **📸 Photo Popups:** Automatically displays a gallery of your favorite memories in the four corners of the screen.
